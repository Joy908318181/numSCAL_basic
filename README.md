# numSCAL: NUMerical Analysis Special Core Analysis Laboratory

_numSCAL_ is a pore-scale numerical simulator developed at Heriot-Watt University as part of a PhD project. The software has been implemented using C++ and Qt technologies and can be used on Windows, MacOS and Linux machines. Moreover, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been coded to allow fast access to the features provided by numSCAL (although a console version is also available if the simulations are intended to run on a Linux supercomputer).
